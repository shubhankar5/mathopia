                        Linear Equations In One Variable

 A linear equation is an equation which involves only linear polynomials. An
 equation like 7x + 2 = 17 is known as a linear equation in one variable.
 Their degree is 1.

 Some more examples are : 
  (i)   52z + 12 = 12z
  (ii)  3x + 25 = 52
  (iii) y - 34y = 3y - 16

 A general linear equation of one variable has the following form : 
 ax + b = 0 { a,b belong to R;  a!=0 }
