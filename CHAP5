                                   CHAPTER 5 : 
                                    Matrices

 Matrices are one of the most powerful tools in mathematics. A matrix is an
 ordered rectangular array of numbers or functions. The numbers or functions
 are called the elements or the entries of the matrix.Matrices are denoted
 by capital letters. Some examples are,
	_     _          _     _ 
       | 2 3 4 |        | 1 0 0 |
   A = | 1 9 7 |,   B = | 0 1 0 |,  etc.
       |_1 9 7_|        |_0 0 1_|

 Types of Matrices:

 In the above examples, the horizontal lines of elements are said to constitute
 rows of the matrix and the vertical lines of elements are said to constitute
 columns of the matrix. A matrix having m rows and n columns is called a matrix
 of the order 'm x n'. Generally, an 'm x n' matrix is a rectangular array.
 If m = n, then the matrix is a square matrix.A matrix is said to be a column
 matrix if it has only one column. 
 For example,
        _   _ 
       |  2  |
   A = |  1  | Here, A is a column matrix of order '3 x 1'.
       |_ 5 _|
 A matrix is said to be a row matrix if it has only one row. For example,
   B = [ 1 2 3 ] Here, B is a row matrix of order '1 x 3'.
 A matrix is said to be a diagonal matrix if all its non diagonal elements are
 zero. For example,
	_     _ 
       | 2 0 0 |
   C = | 0 9 0 | Here, C is a diagonal matrix.
       |_0 0 5_|
 A matrix is said to be a scalar matrix if all its diagonal elements are equal
 and all the other elements are zero. For example ,
	 _     _ 
	| 2 0 0 |
    D = | 0 2 0 | Here, D is a scalar matrix.
	|_0 0 2_| 
 A matrix is said to be an identity matrix if all diagonal elements are 1 and
 all other elements are zero. For example,
	_     _ 
       | 1 0 0 |
   E = | 0 1 0 |  Here, E is an identity matrix.
       |_0 0 1_|
 A matrix is said to be a zero matrix if all its elements are zero.
	 _     _ 
	| 0 0 0 |
    F = | 0 0 0 | Here, F is a zero matrix.
	|_0 0 0_|
 A matrix is an involutary matrix if and only if A^2 = I. Involutory matrices
 are all square roots of the identity matrix. For example,
      _  _  _              _   _ 
   G=|4   -1 |      G^2= | 1  0 |
     |_15 -4_|           |_0  1_|
 A square matrix A is said to be idempotent if A^2 =A. For example       _        _               _         _  
     | 2  -2  4 |             | 2  -2  -4 |
   H=|-1  3  4  |        H^2= | -1  3  4  |
     |_1 -2  -3_|             |_1  -2  -3_|

 Transpose (Denoted by A'):

 The matrix obtained by interchanging the rows and columns is called a
 transpose.Its denoted by A'. If A = A', then the matrix is symmetric.
 If A = -A', then the matrix is called skew symmetric matrix. For example,

 Trace (Denoted by T(A)):

 Trace of a matrix is the sum of all the elements of the principal diagonal of
 the matrix.

 Adjoint (Denoted by adj(A)):

 Adjoint of a matrix is the transpose of the matrix formed by taking the co-
 factors of each element in the respective order.
            adj(A)= C' {C is the matrix of the co-factors} 

 Inverse (Denoted by A^-1):

 If A is a square matrix of order m and if there exists another square matrix
 B of the same order m such that AB = BA = I, then B is called the inverse of
  A.
                    A^-1 = adj(A)/ det(A)

 Matrix addition:

 Matrices can be added only when they are compareable and their orders are
 same.It is similar to basic addition but is just done to all elements in the
 corresponding order.

 Matrix multiplication:

 Two matrices A(m X n) and B(p X q) can be multiplied only when n=p.
 Matrix multiplication is done in row to column way.
