                        Linear Equations In Two Variable       

 A linear equation is an equation which involves only linear polynomials. An
 equation like 7x + 2y = 15 is known as a linear equation in two variables.
 Their degree is 1.

 Some more examples are : 
  (i)   5p + 4q = 12
  (ii)  23x + y = 13
  (iii) 2t + 4v = -5

 A general linear equation of two variables has the following form : 
 ax + by + c = 0 { a,b,c belong to R; a!=0,b!=0 }
