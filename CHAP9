                      Logarithmic and Exponential functions

  Logarithmic function is that quantity which represents the power to which
  a fixed number (the base) must be raised to produce a given number.
  It is denoted as log(base a)(x) and natural log is denoted by ln(x).

  Exponential function is a function of the form f(x) = b^x in which the input
  variable x occurs as an exponent and b is any constant.
