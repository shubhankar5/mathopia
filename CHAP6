                                  Determinants

 To every square matrix A of order n,we can associate a number called
 determinant.It is denoted by det(A)  or  |A|.

 Properties of determinant:

  1) The value of the determinant remains unchanged if its rows and columns are
    interchanged.

  2) If any two rows of a determinant are interchanged, the sign changes.

  3) If any two rows of a determinant are identical then the value is zero.

  4) If each element of a row of a determinant is multiplied by a constant, then
    its value gets multiplied with it.

  5) If some or all elements of a row of a determinant are expressed as sum of
    two terms, then the determinant can be expressed as sum of two determinants. 

 Calculation of determinant:

 Determinant of a matrix can be calculated by choosing one particular row or
 column.Then calculating the co-factors of that row(or column) and then
 multiplying with the corresponding elements of that row(or column).

 A Matrix is called singular if its  determinant value is zero and non-singular
 if its determinant value is not zero.
