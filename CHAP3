                               Quadratic Equations                     

 A quadratic equation is any equation having the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0
 Here, a cannot be zero because if it is, then the equation will no longer be
 a quadratic. It changes into linear.Because the quadratic equation involves 
 only one unknown, it is called 'univariate'. Its degree is 2.

 Some examples of quadratic equations are : 
  (i)   x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0
  (ii)  x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0
  (iii) x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0

 A general quadratic equation is of the form : 
 ax^2 + bx + c = 0 { a,b,c belong to R; a!=0 }
